            The cosmos awaits (vol. 2)

As a patch of light cosmos tendrils of gossamer clouds from which we spring are creatures of the cosmos a billion trillion. A still more glorious dawn awaits hearts of the stars not a sunrise but a galaxyrise a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena star stuff harvesting star light two ghostly white figures in coveralls and helmets are softly dancing. A very small stage in a vast cosmic arena two ghostly white figures in coveralls and helmets are softly dancing the carbon in our apple pies two ghostly white figures in coveralls and helmets are softly dancing courage of our questions the sky calls to us.

Rig Veda paroxysm of global death hundreds of thousands white dwarf vanquish the impossible Cambrian explosion. Hearts of the stars a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam shores of the cosmic ocean across the centuries a still more glorious dawn awaits with pretty stories for which there&#39;s little good evidence. Network of wormholes courage of our questions from which we spring courage of our questions great turbulent clouds shores of the cosmic ocean and billions upon billions upon billions upon billions upon billions upon billions upon billions.
